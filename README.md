# Fence-and-sheepcount-
## NOTE: Here i have imagined two gates, one for entry and the other for exit
### Here the Servos are acting like gates

## Working Principles
#### 1)The Ultrasonic Sensors detect any presence in front of the respective gate
#### 2)These gates only open in one side and work like a valve.
#### 3)Therefore, the gates open by detecting the presence in front of the gate.
#### 4)There is a span of 2 sec for the sheep to move , later the gate closes
#### 5)The entering sheeps are counted as +1, while exiting sheeps are counted as -1, they are added and evaluated to get the toatal count in the field.
#### 6)Since the field is fenced the sheep have to pass to these entry and exit points.
#### 7)So, total count is calculated in this manner.
